- TDA5241 : Brushless DC Motor Driver
The TDA5141 is a bipolar integrated circuit used to drive 3-phase brushless DC motors in full-wave mode. The device is sensorless (saving of 3 hall-sensors) using the back-EMF sensing technique to sense the rotor position. It is ideally suited for applications requiring powerful output stages (minimum current limit of 1.9 A).
